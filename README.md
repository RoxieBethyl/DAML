# Data Analysis and Machine Learning

#### Done in year 2023-24

This in repository are the projects and exercises done during this course. All the code in this repository is mainly `Python` with a few files in `C++`. A brief discription of the main projects done in during this course are listed under [Project Summaries](#project-summaries).

## Project Summaries

### **Project 1: Parameter Estimation with Monte-Carlo Simulations and MINUIT**
- Generated synthetic datasets using Monte-Carlo simulations to simulate decay events, producing 10,000 sets of time values based on a predefined probability density function (PDF).
- Applied MINUIT fitting to all 10,000 datasets to estimate parameters.
- Analyzed the datasets to identify and estimate biases from unaccounted background noise, distinguishing between signal events and noise.
- Generated new datasets with defined signal-to-noise ratios and performed parameter estimation fits on these datasets.
- Evaluated trends in the parameters across different simulations to assess the stability and accuracy of the fits.

### **Project 2: Anomaly Detection in Particle Physics using Machine Learning**
- Analyzed particle data from the standard model to understand baseline characteristics.
- Developed a neural network (NN) model using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn to classify particle data, aiming to identify anomalies that could indicate particles not accounted for by the standard model.
- Trained the model on a new dataset to detect "new" reactions, focusing on anomaly detection.
- Implemented hypothesis testing and applied selection cuts to refine the dataset for better anomaly detection.

### **Project 3: Particle Detector Simulation with Geant4**
- Utilised Geant4 to create a simulation framework for a particle detector, focusing on the design and functionality of the detector in C++.
- Measured and analyzed the energy and energy deposition on the detector components to study the energy ratio and detector efficiency.

### **Project 4: Exotic Searching with ATLAS data and ML Classification**
- Description not provided. (Note: This project lacks a detailed description. Consider adding details similar to the previous projects, focusing on objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.)
